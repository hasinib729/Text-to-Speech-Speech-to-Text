🎙️ Text-to-Speech & Speech-to-Text System

A Python-based project that converts text into speech and speech into text using speech processing libraries. This project demonstrates the practical implementation of Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis concepts in Python.

📌 Overview

This project allows users to:

Convert text input into spoken audio (Text-to-Speech)

Convert spoken audio from a microphone into text (Speech-to-Text)

It is implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment and showcases real-time speech processing techniques.

⚙️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/hasinib729/Text-to-Speech-Speech-to-Text.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd Text-to-Speech-Speech-to-Text

Install required libraries:

pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio gtts

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Open Text-Speech.ipynb and run all cells.

▶️ How It Works
🔊 Text-to-Speech

The system uses speech synthesis libraries to convert user-provided text into audio output.

🎤 Speech-to-Text

The system captures microphone input and processes it using speech recognition APIs to convert spoken words into text.

📈 Future Enhancements

Add Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Add multilingual support

Improve accuracy using advanced AI models

Deploy as a web application
