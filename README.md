# 🎙️ Text-to-Speech & Speech-to-Text System

A Python-based project that converts text into speech and speech into text using speech processing libraries. This project demonstrates the practical implementation of Speech Recognition and Speech Synthesis concepts.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project allows users to:

- Convert text input into spoken audio (Text-to-Speech)
- Convert spoken audio from a microphone into text (Speech-to-Text)
- Understand real-time speech processing concepts

Implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## ▶️ How It Works

### 🔊 Text-to-Speech
Uses speech synthesis libraries to convert text into audio output.

### 🎤 Speech-to-Text
Captures microphone input and processes it using speech recognition APIs to convert spoken words into text.
